.. _sentence_case:

Sentence case
    Sentence case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you only capitalise the first letter of the first word – like you would in a sentence. Proper nouns (including abbreviations, gene names, journal titles, scientific databases, etc.) have initial capitals as well.

    | `Examples:`
    | :sample:`The cat sat on the mat.`
    | :sample:`London is a capital of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.`
    |

.. _title_case:

Title case
    Title case is the conventional way of using capital letters in a sentence. That is, you capitalise all principal words. Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions do not get capital letters unless they start the title.

    | `Examples:`
    | :sample:`Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.`
    | :sample:`Seven Habits of Effective People.`
    |

.. _group_authorship:

    Group Authorship is a large numbers of investigators working under a single group name. Group-author articles involve the following parties: the overall group, members of the group who take responsibility for authorship of the article (named individual authors), and members of the group who do not take responsibility for authorship of the article but have contributed to the work that led to the article (nonauthor group members).

    | `Examples:`

    |

.. _en_dash:
